    <p> Hi, I am James Jass and this is my webpage. I code here with my internet provider, Cox. If theres 1 thing I've learned from 4
      months of coding, you never know just who is going to type in that URL. I am a <b class = "salmon">salmon</b> enthusiast who 
      likes to code <b class = "salmon">salmon</b> into my pages. Other than <b class = "salmon">salmon</b>, I also enjoy tuna and other 
      fish but not as much as <b class = "salmon">salmon</b>.
